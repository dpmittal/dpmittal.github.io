<p> So I am back to blogging but this time I moved to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll </a>
from Wordpress. Maintaining Blog on Wordpress was easy, but Jekyll is amazing.
One more contributing factor of moving to Jekyll that I got this domain
<code>dpmittal.me</code> for free but <b>only for one year</b> by
<a href="https://education.github.com/pack"> Github Student developer Pack </a>
and I didnt want to waste this opportunity :P .So now onwards you will
find me here on Jekyll and not on <code>dpmittal.wordpress.com</code>. Well,
you can find this blog's code here:-
<code> https://github.com/dpmittal/dpmittal.github.io </code>
</p>

<p> I also went through many transistions through these months as I graduated
from high school and joined college which also included in moving outside
hometown. I took <b>Electronics and Communication Engineering</b> at Thapar
University, Patiala. Well, college life till now has been amazing. Got amazing
friends and awesome & inspiring seniors. Here are some snaps of my college :-
