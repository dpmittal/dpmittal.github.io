Today , we know about whats happening in Jammu And Kashmir........ Thousands of people parte from their near and dear ones in this natural calamity that shocked the nation  once again this year....... So  "<strong>Google Person Finder</strong> " can be useful to people to know about their family and friends or inform them about oneself.

According to Wikipedia , <b>Google Person Finder</b> is an open source web application that provides a registry and message board for survivors, family, and loved ones affected by a natural disaster to post and search for information about each other's status and whereabouts. It was created by volunteer Google engineers in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

Google has come up with this system this year  also that too even in <strong>hindi </strong>to help people there so they can  again meet their dear ones and start with a new beginning........ So I would recommend people to promote this so that they can contribute to the initiative taken by Google....
